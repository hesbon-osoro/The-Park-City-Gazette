          <h1>Local Woman Wins Marathon</h1>
          <img src="blake.jpg" alt="blake" />
          <p>
            Park City native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over
            an elite field of the best long-distance runners in the country.
            Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the
            women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker
            and Lisa Peterson finished second and third, respectively. Laura's
            victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and
            Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado
            State.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a
            finishing kick to win the men's marathon for the second straight
            year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race,
            Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not
            match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of Cutler, Colorado, placed
            third in a very competitive field.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field
            in the marathon's history, with over 9500 men and 6700 women
            competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and
            temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.

          <h1>Highway 6 Reopens</h1>

          <p>
            Highway 6 will reopen this Friday, May 3rd, after a final safety
            inspection. A late blizzard delayed road crews, marking this as one
            of the latest dates on record for the highway's reopening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rising to an elevation of 12,351 feet at Grace Pass, Highway 6 is a
            main link between Park City and Lake Elton. The reopening of the
            road is one of the annual signs that summer is near and the tourist
            season will soon be upon us!

          <h1>Cougar Sightings Increase</h1>
          <p>
            Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Park City area according
            to a report released yesterday by the state DNR. In the last month
            alone, there were ten sightings in Park City and the surrounding
            communities of Riley and Dixon. This compares to only twelve
            sightings for the entire spring of last year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include
            increasing encroachment by people into former wildlife habitats and
            new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk
            and deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into
            developed areas, following the herds.
          </p>
          <p>
            DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report
            line at 555-6981 if they believe they have seen a cougar or any
            large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already occurred in the
            west this year from cougar attacks.

          <h1>If You Encounter a Cougar</h1>

          <p>
            Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.
          </p>
          <p>Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.</p>
          <p>Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.</p>
          <p>
            If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your
            arms. Convince the cougar that you are not prey, but a potential
            danger.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.
